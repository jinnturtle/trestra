* [ ] quality: refactor code
** [ ] remove leading underscore from input args
** [ ] make sure method "output" arguments are always at the end of args list
* [ ] quality: fix misleading info and controls in task contextual menu,
probably should decouple from main menu
* [ ] quality: conform with XDG standards
* [ ] quality: default database path should be configurable
** env var
** ? config file

this could lead to tracked time loss since the parents get updated on children
changes.

data components (defaults if task is new) and let user select which to edit via
movement controls
* [ ] feature: support for long notes field related to task
* [ ] feature: "advanced" admin menu or terminal to see/clear deleted tasks,
hanging notes, etc
