= Next Release (1.4)

The next release will be version 1.4

Features slated for next release::
* [x] menu will not show actions not available for selected task (only the root
  task is limited now, in the future parent tasks will have some limitations too
  for safety reasons (e.g. activation))
* [x] task info preview window, a window to preview all the info of a task, this
  will be mapped to `i` and accessible from the menu and explore mode alike
* [x] hacker menu - an in-application command line interface for testing and
  experimenting
* [%] ability to store a body notes in a task (the length of text will be quite
  long or virtually unlimited)
** [x] truncated notes preview from the *Task Info* window
** [ ] a simple text editor to edit the notes

Near future::
* [ ] date and time of last activation and of last modification will recorded,
  this info will be accessible from the *Task Info* window (`i`)
* [ ] `q` will quit the application if in explore mode (will probably open a
  prompt window), instead of just going one level up the hierarchy

== 2.x

* [ ] Reworked *Modify Task* window: Ability to pick and choose fields to modify
  and re-modify before submitting the changes (instead of the current
  _sequential_ process).
* [ ] Session log:
** [ ] Each session on a task will be logged (task id, timestamp, notes)
** [ ] During a session there should be a way to add notes related to that
   session, which then get saved with the log.
* [ ] Task list refresh:
** [ ] A button to refresh any time.
** [ ] Refresh things after returning from the *Modify Task* window.

== Later

* [ ] Tags field.
* [ ] Metadata (key + value) field (and corresponding editor).
